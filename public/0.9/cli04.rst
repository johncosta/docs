CLI 0.4 (OLD)
=============

Old documents
------------- 

The documentation for using the dotCloud Platform with CLI 0.4 are
still available `on the docs site using /0.4/ in the path. <http://docs.dotcloud.com/0.4/guides/>`_

Forced upgrade
--------------

Am I forced to upgrade to CLI 0.9? Not yet. dotCloud will support the
0.4 CLI for a while. You are strongly encouraged to update to the
latest CLI to get the newest features.
