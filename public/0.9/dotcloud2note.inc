.. note::
    CLI Command examples on this page are always provided without the ``--application`` (shorthand ``-A``) argument,
    assuming you're running these commands in a *connected* folder (at creation or using the ``dotcloud connect`` command).
    For more details on *connected* folders, see :doc:`../../guides/migration`.
